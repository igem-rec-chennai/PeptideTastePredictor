# ðŸ§ª Peptide Taste Predictor

A **Streamlit app** that predicts the taste of peptides (Sweet, Salty, Bitter) from their amino acid sequences using a **Random Forest model** and biochemical descriptors computed with `modlamp`.

## **Description**

This app allows users to:

- Predict the taste of a single peptide sequence.
- Upload a file with multiple peptide sequences for **batch prediction**.
- Visualize **feature importance** and **confusion matrix** for the trained model.

It is designed to save time and resources by predicting taste before performing lab experiments.
