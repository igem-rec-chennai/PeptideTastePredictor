ðŸ§¬ PeptideTastePredictor

PeptideTastePredictor is a comprehensive, machine learningâ€“driven web application developed to predict the taste profiles of peptides based on their amino acid sequences and chemical properties. Taste plays a crucial role in food design, therapeutics, and nutraceuticals, and accurately predicting the sensory properties of peptides can significantly reduce experimental costs and accelerate research.

This tool leverages a curated dataset of peptides annotated with taste information and their corresponding physicochemical descriptors. Using AI/ML models, it provides high-confidence predictions for the taste profiles of novel peptide sequences.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features
	â€¢	Peptide Input: Accepts sequences in standard single-letter amino acid notation.
	â€¢	Taste Prediction: Classifies peptides into categories such as sweet, bitter, salty, and umami.
	â€¢	Chemical Property Analysis: Computes molecular weight, hydrophobicity, charge, solubility, and other key descriptors.
	â€¢	Visual Outputs: Displays model accuracy, confusion matrices, and prediction probabilities for intuitive understanding.
	â€¢	User-Friendly Web Interface: Easy data input, result visualization, and interpretation without coding knowledge.
	â€¢	Data Export: Allows downloading of results for further analysis or integration with other pipelines.

ðŸŒŸ Applications
